"extreme long shot","In this framing the reference object (most often a human body) is or would be perceived as very small. This framing is used, for example, to show vast landscapes or skylines."
"long shot","In this framing the reference object (most often a human body) is or would be completely visible (a standing person from head to toe). This field size shows the entire reference object in its surroundings."
"medium long shot","In this framing the reference object (most often a human body) is or would be visible almost completely (a standing person from the head to the shins)."
"medium shot","In this framing the reference object (most often a human body) is or would be only half visible (a standing person from the head to the waist/the thighs), so that, for example, the pistol in Western movies would still be visible."
"medium closeup","In this framing only a third of the reference object (most often a human body) is or would be visible (a standing person from the head to the chest)."
"shoulder closeup","In this framing only a quarter of the reference object (most often a human body) is or would be visible (a standing person from the head to the shoulders). This field size is often used for shot-reverse-shot dialogue sequences."
"closeup","In this framing the reference object (most often a human body) is or would only be partly visible (e.g. only the face of a person). The close-up has a referential relationship to the human face and can also depict other details in 'face-like' framing."
"extreme closeup","In this framing the reference object (most often a human body) is or would only be visible minimally, i.e. a small detail (e.g. only the eye of a person).
"neither","In this framing the reference object is not clear or nonexistent (e.g. the image of a cloudy sky filling up the frame could either be a closeup of a cloud or a long shot of the sky, the composition of the image is abstract or does not create an image space (e.g. the credit sequence of a film)"
