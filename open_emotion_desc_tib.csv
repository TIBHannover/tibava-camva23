excess,"The concept of excess introduced into neoformalist film theory by Kristin Thompson relates to filmic processes that allow qualities of perception to be emphasized beyond their functional purpose, for example a color intensity elevated in comparison with the normal color mode, taking on an independent value by exceeding the symbolic or dramaturgical functions of color; other examples include unusual camera operations, mannerist decor, extremely long shots, and so on. Thompson is interested in the idea of the emphasis of the materiality of the filmic, which at times suspends the narrative as a structure generating continuity in a film and becomes palpable as a ""counternarrative"" or ""counterunity.""

Color is often an essential component of excess."
