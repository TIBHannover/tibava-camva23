Emotion / Affect,Emotion Affect,Global,excess,"The concept of excess introduced into neoformalist film theory by Kristin Thompson relates to filmic processes that allow qualities of perception to be emphasized beyond their functional purpose, for example a color intensity elevated in comparison with the normal color mode, taking on an independent value by exceeding the symbolic or dramaturgical functions of color; other examples include unusual camera operations, mannerist decor, extremely long shots, and so on. Thompson is interested in the idea of the emphasis of the materiality of the filmic, which at times suspends the narrative as a structure generating continuity in a film and becomes palpable as a ""counternarrative"" or ""counterunity.""

Color is often an essential component of excess."

Large parts of the image thus are completely black.

Regardless of the position of the key light, the result is a dark, high-contrast scene. Illumination that creates strong contrast between light and dark areas of the shot, with deep shadows and little fill light."
Lighting,Lighting Type,Global,high-key,"Generally diffuse light, slow fall of shadows, low, selective lighting, bright background: high-key is the lighting style for maximum visibility. Regardless of the key light position, it will always be a bright scene. High-key is a sequence of images or shots in bright, light color values. The spotlighting seeks to attain a level of illumination that is as balanced as possible. High-key lighting is softly graduated in its color values."
Lighting,Lighting Type,Global,chiaroscuro,"Chiaroscuro lighting generally involves the emphasis of oppositions and transitions between light and shadow. Accentuating areas of light and shadow releases the spectator from the coloration of the objects, joining together in a double perception the juxtaposition of areas of brightness and darkness and the simultaneous presence of colored areas. The abstraction of what is depicted and the integration of the visual layers previously separated from one another--gray scale and colors, light value and color value--are linked together. The consequence is often to isolate objects from the space surrounding them."
